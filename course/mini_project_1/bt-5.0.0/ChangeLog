2004-09-08  Mark Willson  <mark@crimson>

	* Verify correct version of Btree file on open.  This involves a
	small change to the structure of the B tree index file.  The first
	word now contains a version identified in the most significant
	halfword, while the ZROOT flag lives in the least significant
	halfword. The routines which get and set block data cater for this
	automatically.

	  lists.
