## [Mini Project 1](https://github.com/minhdq99hp/dsa/tree/master/mini_project_1)
**Objective**: Make a program to manage a computer dictionary.

**Features**: using B-Tree, have Tab completion when searching.

**Team**: 3 members (I'm the team leader).

## [Mini Project 2](https://github.com/minhdq99hp/dsa/tree/master/mini_project_2)
**Objective**: Make a program to simulate the bus map in Ha Noi.

**Features**: using Red-Black Tree (libfdr library), Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Team**: 3 members (I'm the team leader).

## [Theories](https://github.com/minhdq99hp/dsa/tree/master/theories)
**Objective**: Simulate a bus map in Hanoi.

**Features**: using weighted graph, finding shortest path between stations.

**Team**: 3 members (I'm the team leader).
